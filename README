NAME

    Plack::Middleware::Cache - Caching Reverse Proxy for Plack

SYNOPSIS

    # Note! This modules is work in progress, and the
    # namespace overlaps heavily with the module released
    # to CPAN by Ingy dÃ¶t Net, so there are no immediate plans
    # to release this module as such.

    my $chi = CHI->new(
        driver => 'File',
        root_dir => 'common/cache',
    );

    enable 'Cache', chi => $chi, rules => [
        qr{^/api/}          => undef,
        qr{\.(jpg|png)$}    => { expires_in => '5 min' },
    ], scrub => [ 'Set-Cookie' ], cachequeries => 1;

DESCRIPTION

    Enable HTTP caching for Plack-based applications.

    Mathing URI's (rules) are cached with the specified
    expiry time / ttl value to the CHI cache.

    Current implementation (on master branch) does not
    support cache validation. See devel branch for work in
    progress towards this.
